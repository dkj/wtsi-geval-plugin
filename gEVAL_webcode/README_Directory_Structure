Directory structure of geval_website plugin

-conf 

This will contain primarily the SiteDefs.ini and the ini files for each 
assembly.  SiteDefs.ini will be used to set the global settings for the
site such as port, database config for user access and the 
species/assemblies present on the site.  Under ini-files there is the 
DEFAULTS.ini, this will be used to configure the general site details
such as where all the species/assemblies databases are stored on, the
colour scheme of the site, and the images.

-htdocs

This contains all the html pages including many of the landing pages.
It also contains the location of some of the static images used on the
site.  Under info/ contains the pages for documentation and help seen 
on the site.  The walkthrough uses the bootstrap framework.  Under ssi/
contains the species blurb, which is used on the species/assembly's
landing page.

-modules

Under this directory contains the primary code that runs the plugin and
draws the many components in the gEVAL browser.  There are both new and
extensions of generic EnsEMBL module code.

	* Bio/
	
	Its really Bio/EnsEMBL/Glyphset/, where all the code is held.
	At the end of this tree contains all the glyphs used to draw the
	components in gEVAL.

	* EnsEMBL/
	
	Its really EnsEMBL/Web, where the primary code is located.
	This is where all the code used in the gEVAL browser is used.
	For more information regarding the EnsEMBL structure used in this
	set, please visit: http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/webcode/dev/index.html
