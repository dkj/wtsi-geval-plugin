<h1>About the gEVAL Evaluation Browser</h1>

<p>The <strong>gEVAL browser</strong> was initially created to aid in the sequencing and finishing endeavour of the zebrafish genome project, a project that still remains at Sanger, with major reference assemblies such as Zv9 and GRCz10 built and relased by the <em>GRIT</em> team.  The <strong>gEVAL browser</strong> was built with the goals/scope to:
<ul>
<li>Navigate frequent genome assemblies not accessible by any other public genome browsers.
<li>Represent datasets in a way to aid in the user of quickly identifying and navigating problematic regions or regions of interest.
<li>To also provide information to allow the user to resolve these regions so that they can be corrected in a subsequent future release of the assembly.
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
<div>The <strong>gEVAL browser</strong> is managed by the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/genome-reference-informatics-team">Genome Reference Informatics Team (GRIT)</a> at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.</div>
</p>    
<p>The <em>GRIT</em> team is composed of computer biologists/curators and bioinformaticians, whose goal is to reveal and correct quality issues and to identify and add variation for various genome assemblies, many present in the gEVAL browser. 
</p>
<p>
<u>Some of the Projects the GRIT team is working on:</u>
<ul>
<li> Improvement of the human reference assembly, correcting errors and adding variation
<li> Correcting and improving the draft assemblies of 16 mouse strains 
<li> Adding missing gene loci to the mouse reference assembly
<li> Creating new zebrafish assemblies from different strains, developing techniques to enable haplotype resolution
<li> Improving the zebrafish reference assembly through addition of more clone sequence and  integration with a new de novo assembly
</ul>
</p>
