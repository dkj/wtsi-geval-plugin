The mouse gEVAL viewer provides data set which is more current than Build 38.  The difference between this viewer and the mouse AGP viewer(s) is the AGP viewer is based on Build 38, an assembly built in early 2012, whereas the PGP viewer is a more current snapshot.  It also includes clones that are in the sequencing/finishing pipelines and have just been submitted (as of the date of this build).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/index.shtml">Genome Reference Consortium</a> (GRC) maintains and improves the assembly.</p>

<p>There are some major changes in the assembly from version m36; for more details see
