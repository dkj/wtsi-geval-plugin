Schistosoma mansoni is a blood fluke of the genus Schistosoma. Schistosoma are responsible for the chronic debilitating disease schistosomiasis/bilharzia in humans.
<BR>
Since 1994, the World Health Organization has supported a genome initiative for Schistosoma, the Schistosoma Genome Network, aimed at identifying new targets for drug and vaccine development, understanding the molecular basis of parasite metabolism and development and determining biological variation.
<BR>
Schistosoma mansoni has an estimated genome size of 270MB. This sequencing project combines all three sequencing technologies (Capillary, 454 and Illumina) alongside a WGS approach. 
<BR>
Shown to have 7 autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes (female = ZW, male = ZZ). Chromosomes range in size from 18 to 73 MB.
