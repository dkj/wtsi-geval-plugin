<p>The mouse mgsc gEVAL viewer represents the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium's MGSCv3 sequence assembly released around 2002.</p>
<p>The Mouse Sequencing Consortium (MSC) was formed by the National Institutes of Health, the Wellcome Trust, and three private companies (GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Genome Research Institute and Affymetrix, Inc.) to accelerate efforts to sequence the mouse genome. Washington University, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (now the Broad Institute), and the The Sanger Institute were sequencing centers for this project.</p>
