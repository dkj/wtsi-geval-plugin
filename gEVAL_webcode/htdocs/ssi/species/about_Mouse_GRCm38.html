<p>The assembly GRCm38 was released by the Genome Reference Consortium in January 2012. It is based on Mus musculus strain C57BL/6J. The current GRCm38.p(nth) assembly (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000001635.4">GCF_000001635.23</a>)  represents the "nth" minor update of GRCm38.</p> In addition to the primary chromosomes and unplaced scaffolds with unchanged coordinates, as of the third patch (GRCm38.p3), the assembly includes 1 novel and 16 fix patches plus 99 contigs with sequence from different mouse strains.  </p>
