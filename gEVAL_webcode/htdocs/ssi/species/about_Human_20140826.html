 <p>This assembly is based on a Genome Reference Consortium GRCh38 curation snapshot taken on the 26th of August, 2014 and has not been publicly released. It contains applied fix patches, i.e. the corrections have been integrated into the GRCh38 assembly. 
 Note that this changes the coordinate system and hence GRCh38 coordinates should not be compared to this assembly. Assembly alignments are available to allow switching from one assembly to the other. This database does not conatins any 
 alternate sequences or novel patches.
