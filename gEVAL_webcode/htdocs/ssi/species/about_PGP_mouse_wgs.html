The mouse wgs gEVAL viewer represents the Mm_Celera assembly built in mid 2001.  This is the combined whole genome shotgun assembly of Mus musculus. It contains 27 million Celera reads on four Mus musculus strains (129X1/SvJ, 129S1/SvImJ, DBA/2J and A/J), 13 million reads on C57BL/6J from the NCBI Trace Archive, 0.4 million BAC end sequences from TIGR, and unfinished and finished BACs pulled from NCBI (Nature 2002. 420:520-562). <br>
<br>
The assembly process relied on Celera's paired reads and BAC end reads for long range order and orientation. Its scaffolds were mapped to chromosomes using STS maps. For more detailed information about whole genome sequencing and Celera's assembly process, please refer to Venter, J.C. et al. Science 2001. 291:1304-1351.</p>
