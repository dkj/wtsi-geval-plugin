 <p>GRCh38 is the latest version of the Human reference genome assembly released by the GRC on December 24, 2013.<br>
 Some of the highlights of this release include:
 <ul>
  <li>Sequence representation for centromeres</li>
  <li>Fixed and incorporation of assembly and sequence issues</li>
  <li>Addition of more alternate locis</li>
 </ul>
  <p>
   Patches are updates to the reference in between major releases.  This is highlighed by the assembly name and the suffix pX.  For example, GRCh38p2 is GRCh38 major release with the second iteration of patch additions and like previous updates include novel and fix patches.  <br>For specific information regarding the assembly and patch statistics, please visit the GRC page <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/human/data/index.shtml">here</a>
