The difference between this viewer and the human AGP viewer is the AGP viewer is based on the GRCh37, an assembly built on March 2009, whereas the gEVAL viewer is a more current snapshot.  It also includes clones that are in the sequencing/finishing pipelines and have just been submitted (as of the date of this build).

<p>The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/index.shtml">Genome Reference Consortium</a> (GRC) maintains and improves the assembly.
