<p>The <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/">zebrafish
genome project</a> is a collaboration between the Sanger Institute and
the zebrafish community, announced during the <a
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2000/001121.shtml">Sanger Institute
Zebrafish Workshop 2000</a> and was started in February 2001.</p>

The zebrafish gEVAL viewer is a current data freeze from a clone based tile path.  This includes both finished and unfinished sequenced clones.  Clones that have been picked and targeted for a specific region in the path but not yet sequenced are also indicated in the viewer.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/index.shtml">Genome Reference Consortium</a> (GRC) maintains and improves the assembly.</p>

<p>A live status of the current tiling path can be found using the webtool <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/humpub/chromoview">Chromoview</a>.</p>
