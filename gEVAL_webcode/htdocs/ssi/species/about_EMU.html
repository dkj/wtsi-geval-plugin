Echinococcus multilocularis is a Fox-tapeworm, the larval stage of which causes alveolar echinococcosis in humans.
Due to its relative ease of cultivation, EMU is the first of the cestodes (tapeworms) to be sequenced and will serve as a reference for future projects.
E. multilocularis has an estimated genome size of 120MB with a GC content of 43%.
This was the first large scale sequencing project at Sanger to combine all three sequencing technologies (Capillary, 454 and Illumina) alongside a WGS approach.
