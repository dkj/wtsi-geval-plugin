Stronglyoides ratti is a species of parasitic nematode found in rats. This rat model is used for the study of the potentially life threatening human analogue, Strongyloides stercoralis. The genus Strongyloides are parasites found living in the mucosa of the small intestine in most mammals, causing the infection strongloidiasis in humans. This disease usually occurring in the tropics and subtropics, can be dangerous to immunocompromised patients or those receiving immunosuppressive drugs. The larvae from this family are able to penetrate the skin of the host and then travel to the intestine via the blood stream, and can also be passed from mother to young via milk.

For S.ratti the first genetic map of an animal parasitic nematode has been created, this is due to the presence in S.ratti's lifecycle of a faculative free living adult generation.

There were found two pairs of autosomes and a sex determining X chromosome. Females have are XX, while males are XO.

74 molecular markers have been identified, these are PCR amplifiable regions containing 1-7 polymorphisms detectable by sequencing. All markers have been unambiguously assigned to separate contigs. There is no strong conservation of chromosomal location or local syntony between S.ratti and C.elegans another nemotode in a different clade.
