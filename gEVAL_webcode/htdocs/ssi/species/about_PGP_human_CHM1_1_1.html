<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p class="space-below">
<img src="/i/species/pic_Homo_sapiens.png" style="width:100px;height:97px" class="float-right" alt="Homo sapiens" title="doh!"/>The CHM1_1.1 assembly (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000306695.2/" target="_blank">GCA_000306695.2</a> AMYH00000000.2) contains the sequence of a well characterized haploid cell line (CHM1htert) derived from a hydatidiform mole. 
</p>
<p>The assembly was provided by NCBI using assembly instructions provided by the Washington University School of Medicine. Starting by aligning Illumina reads to GRCh37 with SRPRISM, a reference-guided assembler developed at NCBI, ARGO, was used to produce an initial assembly. BAC clone sequences for 387 clones for CHM1 were aligned to the initial assembly and decisions for the best location to incorporate the clones were made manually. Finally, a de novo assembly was incorporated to produce the submitted assembly.  CHM1_1.1 is the most recent iteration which builds on an improved assembly and includes placement/consolidation of unlocalized regions compared to CHM1_1.0.
