genome project</a> is a collaboration between the Sanger Institute and
the zebrafish community, announced during the <a

<br>The zebrafish WGS28 gEVAL viewer represents the whole genome sequence assembly generated from a single Tuebingen, double haploid zebrafish.  The WGS assembly is based on 20,541,433 reads comprising 14,160,626,498 bp with a coverage of 6.5-7x.  WGS28 was used in the building of the zebrafish genome assembly Zv8, by integrating wgs sequence into gap regions in the clone assembly.  </div>
